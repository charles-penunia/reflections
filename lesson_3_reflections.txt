When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use the remote repository when I want to collaborate with others. I would
also want to use it as a backup in case I lost my laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes that I don't want to pull from the Github repository, so I need
to pull changes manunally rather than automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A fork is a copy of someone else's repo from Github to Github. A clone is a copy of someone 
else's repo from Github to a local computer. A branch contains all of the commits that do 
not affect other branches. A fork can be used when I want other users to collaborate. 
A clone can be used when I want to work offline or create a large amount of edits. A branch 
can be used when I want to make custom edits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will be easier to spot recent changes on Github and spot conflicts when the commits are
fetched.
