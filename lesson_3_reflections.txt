When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use the remote repository when I want to collaborate with others. I would
also want to use it as a backup in case I lost my laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes that I don't want to pull from the Github repository, so I need
to pull changes manunally rather than automatically.
