When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use the remote repository when I want to collaborate with others. I would
also want to use it as a backup in case I lost my laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes that I don't want to pull from the Github repository, so I need
to pull changes manunally rather than automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A fork is a copy of someone else's repo from Github to Github. A clone is a copy of someone 
else's repo from Github to a local computer. A branch contains all of the commits that do 
not affect other branches. A fork can be used when I want other users to collaborate. 
A clone can be used when I want to work offline or create a large amount of edits. A branch 
can be used when I want to make custom edits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can easily spot any changes and potential conflicts when I fetch the commits from
the Github repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can use a video chat to directly communicate and share the files among the collaborators. This
approach will get quicker feedback, but negotiation will be more difficult. The approach also relies
on a internet connection, which is not required by Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits 
does each approach have?
I would use a separate branch when creating edits that I would not immediately add into the master 
branch. When using branches, I can recheck the changes before merging. When only using the master
branch, I do not need to worry about conflicts.
