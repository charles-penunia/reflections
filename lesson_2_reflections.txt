What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize my first repository, a file called .git is created.
This file will enable me to create commits so I can use git bash on the
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can control all of the files that can go to the staging area.
I can use the staging area to choose files that I know will function
correctly and leave the other files out.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?
I can use the git diff and git diff --staged commands to compare my
recent changes with the previous files. This will enable me to
see the amount of changes and determine whether I should commit or
not.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be convenient when I am creating versions for different
platforms. I can simply tweak each repository to work for a certain 
platform while keeping the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams help me show which commits are shown when I use the git log
command while checked out on a random commit. It will also help me
determine which commits are unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent 
it in the diagram the way we do?
Lines that have been added from the original file will be added,
lines that have been unchanged will be maintained, and lines that were 
removed will not be included. All of these rules will apply to the most
recent commit, which has parents from each of the merged branches. The
merge is represented in the diagram the way it is because it shows its
relationship with the two branches.
