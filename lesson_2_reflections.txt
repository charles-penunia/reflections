What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize my first repository, a file called .git is created.
This file will enable me to create commits so I can use git bash on the
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can control all of the files that can go to the staging area.
I can use the staging area to choose files that I know will function
correctly and leave the other files out.
